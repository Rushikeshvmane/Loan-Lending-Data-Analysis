# Loan Lending Data Analysis

<h2> Here's the Interactive Project Dashboard link--> https://www.novypro.com/project/loan-lending-eda- </h2>

<h2> Background:</h2>

Forex Club (FC) is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California

<h2> How it work's: </h2>


1. Customers interested in a loan complete a simple application at ForexClub.com.

2. Forex Club leverages data and technology to screen borrowers, facilitate the transaction with appropriate interest rates, and 
service the loan.

3. Qualified applicants receive loan offers and can evaluate their options with no impact to their credit score.

<h2> Objective: </h2> 
  Identify variables that provide strong indicators of potential loan default thus helping Forex club to decide approval/rejection of 
loan.

      
 
  
  * Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who **default** cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this project.
     
<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>PowerBI</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Excel</b>

<h2>Data Cleaning, Data Analysis & Visualization </h2>

1. Using PowerBI ETL tool which is known as Power Query Editor, Data was extracted from excel sheets & csv files, transformed into readable and understandable format with cleaning, proper formating, namimg of columns and rows.
2. Using DAX (Data Analysis Expression) different calculated columns and measures were created which were further used with different kinds of visuals to create an interactive dashboard consisting of many visuals which would generate interesting and crucial insights from the raw data and make it easy for top manamgement to understand the same, in order to take Data driven crucial business decions. And identify the driving factors for such Loan defaults

7. Driving Factors/ Insights:    

    i)  Loan Purpose :- The top two reasons for loans are debt consolidation and credit card. Such applications should be carefully assessed.
    
    ii)  Overall Default Rate stands at 14.59%.

    iii)  Loan approved for 36 months seems to have a greater % of defaulters i.e. 8.37% as compared to loans approved for 60 
           months term 6.22%. So the shorter term for approved loans can be an important factor due to which
           rate of defaulters is increasing in market and neccessary steps can be taken in order to prevent the same. 

    iv) Maximum number of defaulters have 10/10+ years of experience and 0 to 2 years of experience. Hence, Forex Club (FC)
         should take this aspect into consideration while lending loans. 

    v)  91 % of the defaulters already have a mortgage taken out or live on rent, this can be an driving factor that FC should look into. 

     vi)  Among the defaulters, maximum number (38%) of the loan applicants are 'Not Verified'. Hence, Forex Club (LC) should make the norms 
          stringent on 'Verification' aspect of the candidate's reported annual income..
