# Loan Lending Data Analysis

<h2> Background:</h2>

Forex Club (FC) is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California

<h2> How it work's: </h2>

1. Customers interested in a loan complete a simple application at ForexClub.com.

2. Forex Club leverages data and technology to screen borrowers, facilitate the transaction with appropriate interest rates, and 
service the loan.

3. Qualified applicants receive loan offers and can evaluate their options with no impact to their credit score.

<h2> Objective: </h2> 
  Identify variables that provide strong indicators of potential loan default thus helping Forex club to decide approval/rejection of 
loan.

      
 
  
  * Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who **default** cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this project.
